# collab-drumpad

Collaborative drumpad using socket.io

# Installations
- npm install in both folders (client/server)

- To start:

/client - `npm run start`
/server - `node index.js`

Enter a name/id for a session and share the ID with for example a inkognito tab and join the same room. Should be a fairly synced drumpad.
Works with click events and also keys on keyboard (Q,W,E,R,T,Y.U.I.O)
